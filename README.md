## Welcome to Liquid Investigations!

The ‘Liquid investigations’ project is a Google DNI funded project, driven by [CRJI.org](https://crji.org), where coders and journalists work towards making investigative collaborations less burdensome and more secure.

We are creating an open source digital toolkit, based on existing hardware and software. When fully developed, the kit will allow for distributed data search and sharing, annotations, wiki and chat. While the software can run on any server, focus will be placed on small and portable devices.

Please take a look at our website at (https://liquidinvestigations.org)
